For start, you definitely don't want to download with just 40 KB/Second, that's a pain for most of us.

So the first thing we wanna do is install Shadowsocks.

To do that, we have to make sure pip3 is installed, so we do this:


Open Terminal: Ctrl + Alt + T

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install python3-pip`

`sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks.git@master`


After installation, run `sslocal` to see how to set a local client.(PgUp or PgDn in terminal: Shift + PgUp or PgDn)


OK, now, let us set chrome for use:

Get chrome pacage name: `apt --installed list | grep chrome`
Run this program: `google-chrome-stable`


I assume you already installed `Vimium` and `Switchy` plug in chrome.

So the next thing you should do is change the setting of `Switchy`. Feel free to do some google after that.

But now terminal can't use SS yet, so we have to set a http_proxy using `polipo`, google it and set it.
